Glad I'm taking olanzapine or I'd be evem more upset than I am right now. Yay for AP induced blunted affect ;)
NO, NOT ALWAYS @Soph831: @DoctorChristian Do you always get side-effects with Fluoxetine?
@ribazd there is medicines like Fluoxetine but it cant gives you immediate effect also
“@Mofos: @JayZito lol... blow, heroin, Zoloft , trazodone, Adderall, Nexium Dilaudid ... shes a walking pharmacy” That's my girl.
@larryrobs takes years to recognise signs, and double dose of quetiapine, im allowed to up and down meds as an when :)
TRAZODONE IS NASTY AS FUCK WHEN IT TOUCHES YOUR TONGUE
ciprofloxacin: how do you expect to sleep when your stomach is a cement mixer?
Ciprofloxacin + metoclopramide + paracetamol = my new best friends
Wondered why my limbs ached and I was shivering on the hottest day of the year so far. Forgot my venlafaxine. That'll be withdrawal then!
Gonna lay down and try to get some sleep. I really need to start taking my Trazodone to sleep. I kinda hate taking something that knocks
@weswroten Aww! Well thank god for Abilify in my case... Olanzapine and Fluoxetine really fucked me up before hahaha
Let's see what happens when I mix Trazodone with half a bag of chocolate chips.
whoa quetiapine stop making me feel drowsy yo
Lyrically I'm dope enough to ass fuck the dude who made nicotine
My mood swings are getting worse and lamotrigine isn't helping at all.…
@LilithNOT17 I am on 800mg of Quetiapine daily, and have been for many years.
Wellbutrin, Zyprexa, Xanax, Effexor, Lamotrigine, Valium. Every day. I'm not even a person anymore. I'm a parody of an actual human being.
@mc_elhill @mhchat @womblegeorge #mhchat lamotrigine also causes me to have fewer hours sleep a night
@ihateballoons that happens every time I take... trazodone? I think it was trazodone.
@hurley24 I have your Ciprofloxacin.
On 15 March 2013, Eli Lilly successfully defended the validity of its patent on Zyprexa (olanzapine) against a wide-ranging attack by Apotex
@AlekcanderL also, if your dr gave you the sleeping pills get Trazodone from them.
I just took fluoxetine while watching Lakers self-destruct #depression
@Lifeontheedge2 meds can be a life changer, I'm telling you!! I was put on quetiapine recently and it has helped LOADS. Try it x
@beatmydrums lamotrigine! What about you? Xx
@MW1T3K Work must be hard if you're snapchatting Trazodone pyramids.. #cvs #wittycray
And some more fluoxetine.
the smell of my lamotrigine makes me want to throw up this is fucking ridiculous

@joesimpson475 @major___tom In my humble opinion the only reason for prescribing olanzapine is sedation.
SARI: trazodone (sedation, orthostatic hypotension).. NaSSA: mirtazapine (sedation, weight gain, less GI and sexual)
slutty fluoxetine
#Teaminsomnia Guess I should take this trazodone the DR. gave me ... Hate prescriptions ... But need sleep
Walter just said he's self-medicating w/ Dextromethorphan, Clonazepam, and Fluoxetine. Peter says they're all "psychotics."
Do U know what Medications are R for bipolar depression? Currently #FDA approved lamotrigine AKA #Lamictal
@BlockNyo they are the same :-) Salipax and Prozac are trade names for the generic Fluoxetine.
Ciprofloxacin has its intercourse intrusive more sectors extra something like herbal, crackpot supplements, thyr:
@GSXR1KBUSAKILLA but I switched to trazodone ... I was doing some crazy ish on Ambien smh not good lol
@kidds1986 @JSTJODIE I know,come off ur pills I've just come off mine and feel way better for it !! I was on paroxetine an was tired att 2 x
@Gingersquirrel ...quetiapine I drift off right away! I never worry about not waking up, I've been high most of the past 2 years and it's..
@Eqinnastra all the time! I took trazodone last night and it really helped- but it was difficult to wake up :-/
@ManuraNanayakka Fluoxetine is not good. It has a lot of side effects. I think counselling is better in helping people with depression.
@Sectioned_ @bipolarlife7 @BBCWomansHour ah yes, I'm starting to think my paroxetine turns panic attacks into fat.
@lanceharris31 @ryandnoll The Trazodone must've got him.haha 
Tired this morning. And no lamotrigine ping effect to rely on. Second strong coffee it is then!
melatonin+xanax+trazodone & I still can't sleep! only one thing left to try...me-ow!
(This morning's cocktail of meds: 150mg pregabalin, 40mg fluoxetine, 50mg losartan, 500mg amoxicillin, multivitamin. It's fun!)
@angelreader I have no fluoxetine. Unfortunately. Just lots of caffeine.
But I have realised that it's the lamotrigine which causes the joint pain.
Trazodone must be taken early and I always take it late 
@BlondeBiPolar i found that with Olanzapine, been much better since being on Lythium x
@Atomic_Moog as long as it's not paroxetine amirite? #fyantidepressanthumour

My benedryl and trazodone is kickin in!!!! 
lyrically, I'm dope enough to ass fuck the dude who made nicotine.
@JackWestMD ha! iPad corrected memantine to 'merman tine' reminds me of zoolander!
Fluoxetine, Paroxetine, Sertraline, Citalopram and Venlatoxine; why do I need to know this!?!?!
@ecrjones I can just imagine how desperate you are for a bit of peace. Whereas I am now feeling very quetiapine'd so have to say g'night :(

(Sava's trazodone pus pizza)/(birthday crunchwrap throatsong)
@PodCulture Venlafaxine. It's basically a bureaucracy problem in this case, though; nothing to do with the scrip itself.
Co-Codemol and Trazodone have taken control of my eyes, so I better go to bed, before they switch off my legs too, G'nite all, stay safe
I'll be in my room overdosing on trazodone if you want me peace love and goodbye to you goodbye to everything that I NEEEEW
Trazodone >>>>
I forgot about nicotine too. Adding nicotine or caffeine to a range of products: lozenges, food, vapor is drawing the regulators' stink eye.
@huny i deal with the same issues. sometimes all i have is trazodone. working out and eating healthier has helped.
@MHManura if I use ciprofloxacin "cifran 500" haw many days I can feel better cause my penis still put the yellow things without feel pain
@elledub_1920 I can't take trazodone anymore cause I'm up with the baby every few hours. right now I'm mostly concerned with my stress level
Got offered a seat on the tube this morning. Quetiapine, like pregnancy, but hungrier. #bipolarlifestylechoice

Ciprofloxacin pharmacotherapy to all close contacts of Neisseria induced meningitis patients.
Effexor..... ok let's give it a shot.

Slept through the night for the first time in six weeks after making my mother prescribe Trazodone. What a goddamn relief. #selfdiagnosis

Has anyone ever had to take Avelox? I need some tricks to curb the nausea and help me with the hypotension. #avelox #antibiotic #evil
Paxil is worth a try for anxiety/depression.. been out shopping today with a friend, before Paxil i would not have done that!
Thank you Seroquel!!
Cats LOVE the taste of Effexor, a common human antidepressant. A small portion of one capsule can be deadly. Signs may be vague. #TheCVC
I would love to switch my Zyprexa for Xanax.
Oh hell, he's really unwell again. Problem this time is that he's denying it so won't take olanzapine tonight. What can I do?
and this fucking paxil shit doesn't fucking work
My Motto Depression Hurts Cymbalta Works Love Fades Advil's There :D
@amishrobot If this becomes a reality, I’m buying Boniva stock.
2 more hours and I can hopefully say goodbye to seroquel!
If the Blue Jays get perfect-gamed the day after losing on a walkoff walk we might have to put all of Ontario on Paxil.
Grateful for @pparx for the invaluable service. I wouldn't be able to afford my Cymbalta otherwise.
@PoisonOke @bromethazine make the jump to lunesta, worked for me, tho maybe if I had sex dreams more often I would've stayed on seroquel
@BurberryWife sometimes it never ends. So sorry. Topomax is miserable with parasthesia, cognitive problems, kidney stones. Lamictal's good
Seroquel: for when being awake and thinking is too fucking painful

I need help Twitter. I was gradually coming off venlafaxine and now I'm completely off it I've been going though hell.
@JB_Thomas some days the lamictal is worse than seizures.
So Cymbalta used to be an antidepressant, now it's an arthritis medicine. So it's the same medicine that does a completely different thing?
Any body wanna buy me cymbalta, My depression hurts.
Lets play the how long til the seroquel kicks in game!
so watching an ad for cymbalta... more than half deal with side effects... #nothanks
@iamcarrieeeeee @nicclark83 I have a consultant letter saying i must have lamictal- things were ok for 3 months, annoyed it's started again
@ETPC1 all anti depressants have a chance of that happening, I don't think Paxil is much higher.
Seroquel did me good last night *.*
@fibro_360 have BCBS dont cover cymbalta or lunesta. I take savella $75 copay.
Looked up Cipro. And Im being poisoned.

@nicoleccoelho I take fluoxetine and it doesn't do shit it just makes me dizzy and tired
@MentalRiot ah, ok. I’ve been lucky as far a side effects. I’ve hardly gotten any at all. The med I’m on now, Effexor, has been the worst.
FOUND THEM. Starting back up on Effexor. Vomits shall ensue!
I want to sleep so bad. But I don't wanna get up to get a snack to take this trazodone.

The Fluoroquinolone Syndrome <-Have you experienced side effects from taking Quinolones antibiotics (e.g. Cipro) ?
For some reason there is a Trazodone in my Biotin bottle and I keep almost taking it in the mornings.
Maybe cos of the insulin blocking effect of seroquel but I do feel sugar crashes when eat fast carbs. Will feel ill. So avoid where poss.

I've been on Paxil for 10 years for depression/anxiety and at first it used to help but I guess I've built up tolerance and I come too fast.
Keeping medications filled can be a full time job! #Marfan #metoprolol #losartan #simvastatin #warfarin #aspirin, etc...
Delicious supper @cipro tonight. Octopus was so meaty and the flourless chocolate cake was the bomb.
#Pavosic was used BID in patients with neuropathic pain taking Lyrica™ alone or with Cymbalta. This addition provided more pain relief.
@sugar_sw33tz ill be better when we have a talk so that I know there aren't any side effects to you not taking ur cymbalta...lol
Peppermint used in lozenge form, IMHO combines with saliva to form a potent combo which can enter bloodstream & pass the blood brain barrier

I often get the urge to ask metal vocalists if they'd like a lozenge.
Get ur lozenge away from me
the sad thing about my life is that even after 44 straight hours of being awake, i STILL had to take seroquel to get any real sleep.
Fuck some lamictal...almost died. #fuck
The key to ultimate success and unlimited money is to develop a sore throat lozenge that actually works #fastreliefmyass

@darthcookster Unfortunately I started Humira around the same time, so it's hard to parse out. But I've felt great, definitely more energy.
@almostwell what problems did you have with humira, if you don't mind me asking. I tried infliximab it destroyed my liver.

Anyone out there on the internets have experience, personal or otherwise, with Lamotrigine? If you do, DM me please? Not urgent.

@ETtube Ah good. I thought you suggested dabigatran patients need ASA. Threw me for a loop.
I prescribed quetiapine to my obese patient along with a #paleo diet. He still takes quetiapine, but is no longer obese & health is good :D

Drove to hospital for #Tysabri in Blue. Left early (London traffic), only took 20 mins! Blue Badge space next to entrance. #winning #fuckms
Why not to take vyvanse late in the day: I just cleaned my entire kitchen. It's 3am. #addproblems @vyvanseswag
Going to see my #psychiatrist for the first time in a month this afternoon to get my #Seroquel refilled and things. Hopeful.:) #menalhealth

@SAlldread oh no - what kind of sick? R u running temperature? Have u noticed any reduction in symptoms since u started Humira?
@LJ2510 It has helped somewhat yes. Is Fluoxetine not somewhat old? Prozac etc. Should you not perhaps favour an SNRI over SSRI?

@FUCKIPEDIA a throat lozenge
The amount of time a throat lozenge actually helps my throat is equivalent to the amount of time it takes me to finish it.
i still laugh about when tyrel and his gf broke up in 7th grade so his fb stat was "depressed :/" & zach commented "cymbalta can help" haha
It's official! In 2 weeks, I'll be adopting a sweet little baby guinea pig! I've decided to name him Viibryd, and nickname him Vivi. :)
Seroquel always treated me well. Makes ya pass out and pass out HARD.
Oh my god. It's 5:19am and I am just now realizing that I accidentally took a vyvanse at 11pm... That explains why I can't sleep.
When hunger hits, its probably time to stop popping vyvanse.
Due to the PML risk, Tysabri is recommended for patients who have had an inadequate response to, or cannot tolerate, an alternate therapy.
@Sami_Motin any side effects? My neuro recommended Tysabri as first option but I was scared. Went with Gilenya
My breakfast of choice is a cup of Starbucks coffee with a side of 70mg Vyvanse.

@esinclai wonder how and if this affects Humira. No big thrashing in ABBV stock value, so maybe not at all.

Paroxetine, may make it hard to have an orgasm.
Anyway, I've found a 4 in 100 figure, BUT it only relates to paroxetine and is for all malformations. (Background 3 in 100)
So yes, relative risk is doubled. But absolute risk is halved compared to what they say. And only for paroxetine.

Lamictal dosage increases kind of wreck my head for a day or two. But they also make me super productive as long as I can do things slowly.
