When the Doctor says to start taking your medication again. Hello ~Lexapro, Topamax, & Trazodone
But I don't want to take an ambien or trazodone or anything because i dint wanna restart my dependence upon them
@BBCPolitics Yea right. It's the calm before the storm. Either that or the fluoxetine in the water is beginning to work.

@Shell_568 Aye and the kennel's called Fluoxetine!
Have run out of Olanzapine, was tapering off anyway but this is a bit too quick-feel restless. Hot bath and diazepam time :(
Also the lamotrigine dose feels a bit high too now the O is leaving my system. Will have to adjust that as well or I won't sleep *sigh*
If I become high I will not increase the lamotrigine as this will fuel the sleep problems
I will take 2.5 mg olanzapine and Zopiclone to settle my sleep.I will intervene early, and not leave things until I am euphoric
Want to quit #smoking? Try nicotine replacement therapy like gum, lozenges & patches to help end your cravings #OLW
Venlafaxine is not my friend...
who wants 2 buy nicotine lozenges frum me!! all the high of a cigarette without the smoke!!!!!
Survived the non-Venlafaxine disaster with Diazepam. Home now, thank fuck, with the medication & some Zop imbibed. Should be OKish tomorrow.
If I HADN’T got the Venlafaxine, tomorrow would have been BEYOND a disaster. That stuff is insidious & cruel. But sadly necessary :(
Popped a trazodone, I'm sleepin!

Reducing the lamotrigine is grim. Exhausted and grumpy. Got another 2 weeks of this yet. Wondering if I'm doing the right thing?
@mhigby Melatonin is often incorrectly prescribed. Try trazodone. Cheaper. Non-addictive. Prevents "thought cycles" that inhibit sleep.
Hehe, trazodone is sometimes called trazoBONE because of its priapism effects. #medschool #pharmacology #mature
Why does tapering down lamotrigine feel as yucky as stepping it up? #soreashell
My GP should write on the Venlafaxine prescription Avoid #TheVillage.
antipsychotics: quetiapine (sedation); olanzapine, risperidone, aripiprazole, lithium as augmenting agent
thank you Lord I do have another Trazodone! Good night.
LOL NO. None are anti-psychotics. Dextromethorphan is Robitussin, Clonazepam is for anxiety like Xanax, and Fluoxetine is Prozac. WTF FRINGE
Did you know that in the US they put Fluoxetine in the main water supplies. This ingredient is also known as Prozac! :(
Anyone taking lamotrigine suffer with headaches weeks after starting the med?
I can't wait for the drug disposal day in my city. I took the freaking Trazodone by mistake again and if the problem doesn't go away, ER :/

How many people are fully aware that they pushed the drug Cymbalta for depression, it didn't work, now its a pain medication. No. It's not.

@Lanternlizard yes. I have counseling every 2 weeks. Currently on lamictal, Prozac, Seroquel xr, but switching to geodon
@illtreaturite1 Fluox a friend 4 years, but switch to cymbalta 4 anti-depress/pain control. I OCD worry. Can't stop running mind
@janhopis no, I was (and am) on venlafaxine. I have a non-problematic heart arrhythmia, so I guess that's when it's problematic...
@PaxilParox no paxil you have to move people are trying to look at FA

Depression hurts, Cymbalta can help.
Clozapine, risperidone, quetiapine... These antipsychotics sound like names for new Pokémon. Or maybe I'm just crazy. #makenosense #psych
@BipolarBlogger that's the balance I'm finding hard - side effects I'm willing to endure v effectiveness. Previously Quetiapine made me so..
@psTRUTH4U get yourself a cold drink, some olanzapine and a mind of your own, you deluded freak.
Forgot to take my iron supplements, folate supplements and fluoxetine. :( and I just realised.
Cymbalta mulct as well demonstrated over against upspear the moves pertaining to serotonin conjunction norepinep:
Does anyone have any idea where on the new cipro website one can check if a company name exists/ does not exist on their database?
@stilgarg I'm ok ty have an official diagnosis of Bipolar now, feeling ok at the moment lamotrigine has been increased having monotherapy:/
WS Waring @acutemedicine After massive olanzapine overdose, serum levels may remain high for over 72 hours #SAMCoventry
@KarimS3D Olanzapine actually makes you put on weight, even when you aren't eating that much
@DoctorChristian is my memory really bad due to 900mg seroquel and 120mg cymbalta or the bipolar itself? I'm not remembering conversations
@SpicyNyx fluoxetine and quet combo zombified me...ah, the meds merrygoround #bipolar
@story3girl Hopefully the Lamictal will start kicking in by the weekend.
@PotterGotSwag 20..she was on Lamictal,a doc in Egypt prescribed it for her but it just doesn't work well so we went back to frisium..
Can't be starting out with one of them days because i have to get my baclofen pump replaced today. It's 3yrs old. ;-)
olanzapine is supposed to make you a fat bastard i got off lucky. lithium makes my hand shake. bipolar or schizo drugs.
Not to far from depression..... Fuck cymbalta !
I wonder if cymbalta really does help depression. I wanna test it on someone lol
I'd rather be on the Effexor that made me happy though I had severe back pain from it.. Than sad and crying for no reason on lexapro....
I'm just glad I finally have a handle on my bipolar issues. Cymbalta for the WIN! #BeenCrazy
@CIPROisPOISON ironically, the pulmonologist I work with told me about his own devastating bout with 'tendonitis' after Cipro
@DoctorChristian @keirshiels ever heard of NMS with Venlafaxine
Trying a new anti-depressant. Effexor, anyone? I hope it works.
Today my hospital is getting Zyprexa IM. Im very excited about this!! Haha, its the little things like PRNs that make Psych Nurses happy!
@_Emigrant @Ghonim what if they are resistant to pencillin?? try levaquin 250 mg daily for 12 days + rest. :)
@PLwithMS I've been on tysabri 4 years. I'm on a few others as well.
@CaroleWhelan I'm mostly able to manage the pain without having to take m/any prescription drugs - today was a bad baclofen & codeine day
Kamon pica.. No seroquel for tonight. Push yourself.
Of atypical antipsychotics, clozapine (Clozaril) is least likely to cause EPS or tardive dyskinesia. Quetiapine (Seroquel) next in line.

@SpicyNyx *lamotrigine Fucking stupid typing thumb. :) x
Depression hurts Cymbalta can help
@Emmaleigh504 Effexor FTW. Nuke it with powerful mind-altering drugs. Worked for me
@rachelwhitney_ @apatterson_2 @adrian_stephens I filled some olanzapine today. Made me think of DAD #antipsychotics #pharmschoolproblems
Some days I could really use some Cymbalta #oneofthosedays
@moorcroft40 @Live2Learn4Life I agree. Plus if u missed ur Tysabri it's bound to have an effect. Good days & bad, but keep that strong mind
If I'm still sick after avelox I'm going to cry
@IndeedItsSarah8 2 death threats wow...cymbalta can help
I agree w/ @MarkEiglarsh . She's faking it. they know it, but they're basicly 51/50 ing her. @DrDrewHLN I'm sure the "medication" is Zyprexa
@builtinbc oh I thought cymbalta was a pain med. sorry, that sucks.
Depression hurts .. Cymbalta helps ... side effects may include weight gain/loss fatigue and thoughts about suicide
I just realized that the word "Paxil" has the word "peace" in it.

Time to lay down. Trazodone is kicking in. Zzzzzzzzz
@rcowsert This one takes Seroquel.
Eat a 300mg seroquel and try to stay awake all night
I definitely need Cymbalta after that episode.
My psychiatrist is going to be furious with me for just stopping taking Cymbalta all of a sudden (and rightfully so), but it's EXPENSIVE.
@addyeB meant to tweet you today...did all work out with your meds? Did u start the Lamictal?
Fun Facts: Do you know what Medications are R for bipolar depression? Currently #FDA approved #quetiapine AKA #Seroquel
Stomach problems are creeping back, back on the Cipro. :-/
@AlissaCerro buy me some cymbalta then
Trazodone talk #itsfine
I pray that i never have to take these meds they be showing these commercials for. Cymbalta & shit like that.
I think medicare is catching up. Sore foot may be broken, for no reason. UTI symptom ends up some kind of liver thing. Cipro, xrays, etc
I’m hoping I will get taken off Seroquel and switched to Lamictal, tomorrow.
Why seroquel can make me put on 20 over kg: it acts like an insulin blocker or something.
"What's the next holiday? Memorial day, yeah. Your getting Paxil for memorial day."
@jessindia I take fluoxetine and quetiapine. The quetiapine is the one with the massive sleepies, althouth the flouxetine doesn''t help.
10 seroquel and hopefully wake up late tomorrow? This whole week is just so shit and gets worse and worse
@DocWashburn I'm not trying to start any immature fight with you. But ask you to realize how dangerous "medicine" is. Like "cymbalta".
@nuttylotte Exactly. Although the Lamotrigine is apparently to help prevent future episodes of depression & the plan was to reduce my
@MissRabbitxo I took Ativan, didn't work at all. Now I take Paxil (Paroxetine) works like a charm.
“@briannahegarty: Want Beverly to know: Depression hurts, but Cymbalta can help!”
JC virus test today... Lets keep those fingers crossed I remain negative! #Tysabri #MS
Quetiapine is known as “Quell” & “BabyHeroin.” When combined w/cocaine it is termed “Q-ball.” #camhRounds
@Irish_Quack What about a combo pill. Statin, diazepam, fluoxetine and Imodium - sorts just about everything out ))
@crimefish @EverydayAbleism I'm on Quetiapine so can't make early mornings. Oncology give me midday. Why can't ATOS and my psychiatrist? Xx
@chichistarr73 @SethroOnTheTV Never mind, I just saw what he said. (giggle...) I am a soap fan and I don't need Paxil.
@shannonashleyb eat your gushers, take your cipro and shut up.
@lapsangsusie @Mental_Elf yes lamotrigine licensed in USA/UK for Bipolar, main use epilepsy=confusion. Please chat with Dr before stopping
@REALBROTHER0003.. Still hearing voices.? If I were you I start with Seroquel 100mg bid. Should minimize them voices.. #psychosis #bipolar..
Last night, I had a dream that @bromethazine and I were going to have sex, but I was too tired. Seroquel is the devil.
@jubies33 Why did my doctor put me on Cymbalta for Fibromyalgia? What ever happened to good old fashioned narcotics?
@pabloeldiablo77 I hope to see a dr and get off the * seroquel when I'm about 30 days in. have to be tapered off. huge pain in the rump.
Depression hurts... Cymbalta can help. @Megansaurr
only been on paxil 20mg for 10 days and takes 3-4 weeks to properly kick in.. best ssri i have tried so far. i think its worth a shot!
And after ten days of PAXIL I am 5 times more assertive, side effects are wearing off im feeling positive :)
Just mistook a Cymbalta commercial for a preview for a new Nicholas Sparks movie. Too bad. It looked like a good one.
Anybody take Trazodone and can tell me how it makes them feel? #newmeds
Some y'all on my TL must be miserable, Cymbalta can help.
Another #lyme suicide. So sad. #lyme suicide is typically a #limbic #seizure? #Neurontin, Lamictal, Depakote and #Klonopin can help
@ALivingLie_ @amanda_stand Still won't consider SD for me, just quetiapine still
Depression hurts, cymbalta can help
One child's POÄNG chair built, the rest of the furniture can wait til the morning! What a day. Tysabri infusions and IKEA have killed me.
EFFEXOR IS THE WORST DRUG IN THE MOTHER FUCKING WORLD JESUS GOOOODODOFASDFOSDFOSDF
So, I lasted 16 days on Seroquel. I couldn't handle the awful side effects. Constantly dizzy and lightheadeded & a myriad of other bad stuff
@santypas @LouiseStockwell the proof is in the pudding I'm a Tysabri patient last yr I was nearly bed bound today I walk and stand for 24min
@crimefish Bum. I was worried about mania on them, but I think the biffiness is going to be worse, especially coupled with Quetiapine.
@SchizophrenicGB Ah yes, there's always that option ;-) I need Trazodone, no matter how tired I am, my brain wouldn't switch off otherwise
@SchizophrenicGB I can understand that, the Trazodone are a top-up anti-depressant, so they're not addictive, my other AD don't cause sleep
@fabsternation Sorry Fab, I can offer some Fluoxetine (Prozac), if that is any help?
Sleep timer set. 1 trazodone, this shouldn't take long 
Who is Peter Cipro!?!?
@RipnerCabbit @pacerfox Ugh. My partner was on Paxil for a while. It made him hide in the apartment. :/
@kathryntyne I have to take Trazodone to get to sleep, and apart from my cat, I'm always alone
@_cimmy_ thanks! yes, after I was prescribed Cipro a few years ago, and it REALLY messed me up, I am quite wary of broad spectrum ones.
Quitting those nicotine lozenges I've been using for a year, so I may write some rude tweets. Like this one: @realDonaldTrump UR A BIG DWEEB
So, who do I know on Cymbalta?
@walkbythesea Wellbutrin doesn't seem to be cutting it anymore, so I'm transitioning to Cymbalta.
@florida_gay @ac_ec now I'm gonna think of cipro
@ICU_CCRN and had to start metoprolol XL a few years ago. IST tends to be not well known.
If you talk bad about Lebron I hope a thug shoots off your great toe and all the Vancomycin and Cipro in the world cant cure the infection.
@deliriunfishies I've tried both citalopram and fluoxetine and both have had bad side effects on me. Try something else.
Tried a cymbalta & didn't hurt all over for half a day. Does this mean the mysterious pain no one can diagnose actually *is* fibromyalgia?
@Get_Out_MyFace It was actually me. PLOT TWIST!!! Now text me back, or I will go into a depression that even cymbalta can't fix
@Basic_Chunnel @bromethazine I'm pretty lucid in all my dreams, and the Seroquel drowsiness carried over into the dream. LOLOL.
I only have like 3 days left of my trazodone and I don't have refills GREEAAATTT :(((
My parents snore so bad. Sharing a hotel room with them is going to be the death of my. I NEED MY TRAZODONE
Codeine and seroquel it is then
I'm completely off Valproate now, should wash out of my system completely by midweek. Two days into Seroquel XR, so far so good.
@JoeStrauss are you kind of a grumpy guy. In a twisted way you enjoy local teams falling short. Paxil or lexapro?
Just took my zyprexa and lithium. Hahaha. And this cigar is going great with my mocha.
@monay925 want some of my cymbalta?
@kyleecakes4 I was given like 5mg of Abilify and I still do not recall the dosage of Trazodone.
anybody out there ever take Cipro and had really bad things happen as a result?
I think this is why GP thought I had fibro initially. But I do not get these symptoms off the lamotrigine or on 175mg, just on 200mg
@DrYobbo Nope. Cymbalta is new. But she will be right, I just want to go and work.
@Snuff_Smith I think Cymbalta is a combo of a bunch of other drugs. Was just talking with someone else about this earlier
Cymbalta and coffee...breakfast of champions! Nom. Nom. Mom.
I've decided I'm really not happy with the pain lamotrigine is causing or the poor sleep. I am thinking of asking for a trial of Prozac and
@Snuff_Smith @DanieTreg I understand discontinuation syndrome is a bitch when coming off Cymbalta. Then again it sucks for all SSRIs & SNRIs
Does anyone know if the #weight gain is less in #olanzapine combined with #Prozac(#symbyax) than in olanzapine alone?
@bipolarblogger The misery I'm experiencing today from the pain, outweighs the anti-depressant effect of the lamotrigine
I can only get about 7-8 hours of sleep on my own. But I got at least 16 hours with Seroquel. I now see how people can get addicted.
@FemalePTSD Yep. I don't even need to be on monthly - imagine if I took a month's lithium and quetiapine...! Want 3 monthly again.
I feel siiiiiiiiiiiiiiick. Damn you venlafaxine.
@Katelli_Pasta lol the only one I can remember is "Depression hurts...Cymbalta can help!"
@fibroseize If not happy with Cymbalta, please, please look into Savella! Dual uptake inhibitor. Blocks nerves AND uptake in one dose.
one time i liked a guy and told him i was sad a lot and he told me to take cymbalta and thats why i hate people
@GaiaTheorist Im fucking possible .... You'll never do it... Not without an accomplice and fluoxetine **grabs keys, grand antidepressants **
First night without seroquel and my sleep pattern has already turned to shit!
Not to mention the thousands of people online who say they’ve stacked on the weight due to taking seroquel.
I go back in 2 weeks and am determined to lose weight by then and prove her wrong. Should be easier with lamotrigine!
As usual the pharmacist didn't have my lamictal because the GP has refused to issue it. I think I'm at the point where I want to change GP
I actually thought that because I was on seroquel for 8 months that I might be able to keep good sleep patterns going when I discontinued it
@cheer_bear13 I've never had any brand other than Lamictal
@IntegrateMD I sure wish my doctor had told me Cipro could disable me for life! There was never any mention of that. Now I'm crippled.
@elizavetaka @_cimmy_ Cipro is a potentially crippling poison--as are the others in its class. You're smart to run the other direction!
i feel genuinely well on paxil i can't stop saying this enough and it makes me happy
@MondaysMomma It's ok, I guess it's just a case of trial and error with antidepressants. Coming off venlafaxine has been so nasty :(
I'm getting put on olanzapine medication, does anybody know what they're for ??
Yesterday was almost a blur...seroquel and marijuana really got a nigga not giving a fuck. I was pretty zooted yesterday.
Niggas be like "what's seroquel?"
@gusgreeper I can't believe how long it takes to be symptom free from this shit #paxil
Who will hook up and who overdoses this week on It's All Gone Fucking Wrong? We will need a couple psychiatrists with unltd Seroquel.
@nelliee06 your tweets are depressing me. haha. #paxil
reviews flow more easily with the assistance of beer. Though not taken quetiapine yet.
@lymeandme seems unclear what really works and how u know. :/ I really went downhill when I got off Effexor, but maybe it just masked stuff.
@BrianDurieMD attempted to view Zometa video. Says it is private? How do you access it?
@CIPROisPOISON @_cimmy_ I hope you are doing better now. Yes, a small dose of Cipro a few years ago did get me two or so years of problems.
@Loribelle19 Oh my goodness! Lori, this is unreal! I am so sorry you are suffering. *hugs* Have they tried Cipro?
“@UberFacts: Ferrets can suffer from depression.” Ahh, yes of course. They should make a depression commercial for Paxil with ferrets.
@EmilySpinola I missed you so so so much today!!! Now I need to take a ton of #CYMBALTA 
Made the perfect cocktail for tonight: Effexor, klonopin, minipress, abilify and a splash of diet coke. Yum! 
@cintain I can't drink with my Lamictal for my seizures. One drink and vertigo sets in. :( Without epilepsy medication, yes, I do.
@cintain If I had a live-in acupuncturist, I wouldn't need the Lamictal. 5 minutes with mine while out w/ friends & no seizures for a week
#Duloxetine is efficacious and generally well tolerated for management of #symptomatic #knee #OA in both older and younger patients...
seroquel and vodka!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! JOIN ME
Depression hurts . Cymbalta can help .
“@FadeKidd17: Depressed.” Cymbalta ?
Get some abreva and rub it on your cock b4 u use it next. Or take some avelox.
I only have half a seroquel left :/
@lynn_521 so, Cymbalta is going generic. Yep that's about all I've got in the drug industry at the moment.
Giver her some stress relieving pills. Like Cymbalta.
 “@Ras_Tin: "Depression hurts.. Cymbalta can help"”
@kimmyxoxo I didn't try Cymbalta, but it was a combo of an antidepressant and klonopin. Turned my life around.
Not putting up with this pain all night so seroquel it is
my sim card isn't working aaggh i feel like im having cymbalta withdrawal again aaagh aaaggh
@preesi Yes to depression and anxiety. Was on Cymbalta had to stop for chemo. Worked ok but would have liked better. Seeing dr soon 4 new 1

Nothing tastes worse than lamictal absolutely nothing
@nicolapow Thanks am so chuffed, got so big on Olanzapine, been working hard for it x
One beneficial side effect of venlafaxine can be increased concentration and focus. I think I'm feeling that today :-)
hamilton will take a set of the hard compound and a paxil at his next stop
@711ace Olanzapine carries a warning that the drug can cause death among elderly people who have psychosis due to memory loss and confusion.
@USHEMP Very generalized thinking. I'm on Xanax & Cymbalta, does that make me dangerous? No, it does not. Sounds like sensationalism to me.
@zoeAWESOME glad GET is helping; it just made me worse but the CBT helped me focus. I have tramadol, baclofen, paracetamol, ibuprofen
@wildpursuits LOL! I'm sure he does!!! I look like I should be on Paxil or something.
T minus 5 hours till game time. Go to your pharmacy now for your Cymbalta Xanax or whatever your preferred anxiety medication is #NYRBelieve

i know for a FACT that alcohol does not deplete the seroquel levels in your blood, YET HERE WE ARE
If you’re Bipolar II, GET LAMICTAL. I’m on 600mg/day. Haven’t spent an evening screaming into a pillow in seven years.

Depression hurts an if you're too broke for cymbalta eat nilla wafers
a list of failed medicine: prozac, wellbutrin, cymbalta, ativan, seroquel.
@Verlieren THANK YOU! It didn't even fucking work. I went back to ziprasidone but now will never have another orgasm in my life.
@melissaleahsays Lamictal tends to work better on bipolar d/o with longer MD episodes, rather than longer hypomania or manic episodes.
things i learnt from 23andme: Substantially increased odds of remission from depression when treated with Elavil, Paxil, Effexor, or Celexa.
@liver_bird_87 @MizTinkerbella when I was on cymbalta and visanne I could not orgasm at all!!!
@toddgordontrade Tetanus shots r good for 10 years. Metal through rubber shoe- need a good cleaning, possibly Cipro to prevent infection.
@Lisalu64 oh geez. My lamictal has been increased today. Yay!!! LOL. We will see.
Got a script of Cipro for a uti for #motherday. LOL, thank God for walk in clinics.
@kevinmd Even w the best care a patient can die from Avandia, Vioxx, get kidney failure from Cipro or commit suicide on new antidepressants

Depression isn't easy; Cymbalta can help.

Will #Elan shareholders see this $1bn Theravance deal as the right way to spend remaining $2.1bn of Tysabri cash?
'A ciprofloxacin resistant bacterium in the microbiota is responsible for norovirus persistence' but not yet identified bacterium #CMHH
@iamcarrieeeeee Coming off the lamotrigine. It's not acceptable to be in pain most of the time. Struggled to get out of the bath on sat
@MikeyJ norovirus persistent carriage -> gave mice cipro -> norovirus was lost, assumes bacterium is involved
need some seroquel
So on #Elan we have royalties from Tysabri, #Royalty Pharma bidder, new #Theravance royalty deal & now Royalty Management company. Got that?
How is it almost five am?! I know I made the wrong decision tonight. Choosing between Flexeril and Trazodone is hard. :(
The drugs don't work!!! From fit to hobbling in a few days. Off the pills but may need wks to recover & be prone to ruptures #ciprofloxacin
@KinkiNoNeko I take venlafaxine. Happy to discuss in DM.
@Chavielle i has beta blockers now, apparently the fluoxetine can cause panic attacks ^_^
@RxCare007 @Lanternlizard my combo: lamictal, Seroquel XR transitioning to zeodon, fluoxetine, have topamax for migraines as bonus adjunct
@RxCare007 @Lanternlizard use quetiapine IR hs PRN sleep. Works better than anything else to knock my ass out. Including ambien and restoril
@MHManura What is the difference between Citalopram and Fluoxetine?
I don't have any obligations today so I'm taking 1 and ~a half~ Seroquel. Hashtag living dangerously.

Questionable X-ray result. Nothing a little levaquin won't help. Oh yeah and the cough meds with codeine.
Manufacturer unable to supply Baclofen. Might not be available for weeks. Only have a few strips left. Anyone know of an alternative? #MS
@TheEttinauer Even weirder: I haven't taken Paxil in 14 years, but I still feel like that NOW.

@AlterEgoTrip_Se @theprovince Confession: They put me on Effexor just because I was "fellin' a lil' blue." That's some tough stuff!

One Tunes cherry menthol lozenge + one cup of earl grey = homemade menthol tea. Fuck you cold virus.

Scary movies and lots of caffeine and I didn't take my Seroquel I feel like such a rebel >:D and I also feel like an idiot but that's normal
"lozenger" or "lozenge"? i prefer "lozenge" cause "lozenger" sounds weird to me. or i'd just say "cough drop" instead #randomness :)

going off of olanzapine is no picnic. you have to be prepared to ask the aid of the gods, Jesus, Krishna.
of course olanzapine is designed in such a way that supposedly going off of it is impossible. i disagree. all things are possible to God.

@MargoJMilne Hi Margo, how are you today? Still down here, my doc inc'd my venlafaxine to max yesterday, so hopefully better days ahead. xx
I even took a trazadone which really helped me sleep. However, I've too much on my mind at the moment.

Can you stop pacing up and down on the train and get some Zyprexa you psycho
I wish I took my vyvanse
Depression hurts. Probably because you ate too many PopTarts. Cymbalta™ can help. (For best results, take with Metamucil.) #BT140
Speaking of stress I forgot my Prozac again today #dammit
#humira ouch jab mark from yesterday #crohns pic.twitter.com/G9ZayajI5h
@SoDakPB Why does The Writer's Almanac have to sound like it's OD'd on Prozac? Writing is exciting! Make it sound that way!
@imanhaddi yes, it is. You're on Humira, right? Is it working as you'd hoped?
MRI, bloods, scope booked in. 4weeks of anti biotics, back to 30mg preds. Humira probably being brought back in as a combo treatment (yay)
benefit of not drinking anymore : 1 glass of pinot in the sun makes you VERY HAPPY. like tinker bell on prozac. #drinking #wine #summer
@Dennis_Walters kind of like you're prozac or is it the whiskey.
My body is so not ready for this seroquel. Never had an antidepressant knock me the fuck out at a quarter dose before o _o
I want to be throat cuddled by a giant lozenge
@helloimmarta @prozac @mary_ey I don't accept negative answers, so we can do it. It'll work. <3
Goodmorning world!! It's gonna be a good day of class. *Pops VyVanse*

If it wasn't for vyvanse I wouldn't be raping these exams
This coffee got me feeling like I popped a vyvanse. 
TRAMPEZE showed that zoledronic acid and strontium-89 had no significant effect on clinical progression free survival. #ASCO
"@a_george126: Depression sucks." Cymbalta can help
@lilturnerrr I need at lozenge so bad right now
Exams+vyvanse= OWNED BITCH
Also these eyedrops are called "ciprofloxacin ophthalmic solution" which sounds a lot more like some rad bomb liquid
"@_blvze: @CallMeCastil it's okay :/ "depression hurts, Cymbalta can help"" *cries softly*
Stop asking me for vyvanse! Good God!
@Back_datASHup same lol didn't eat a thing, damn vyvanse

@Scarred_Girl me tooooo!!! Prozac is the name of the pills?? Idk.. I just want to see if I'm the only one who takes medication ://
Just got a spam tweet saying they wanted to hire me. Their bio: "A liberal is nothing but a communist on Prozac!" Yeahno.
Anyone have experience with a depressed cat? More specifically I think a pissed off cat. He's on kitty prozac...which isn't working great...
.@m_cetera why oh why do i always read Prozac instead of Prosec?
Hey brother, can you spare a Paxil? I'm terrible at this panhandling shit.
I take Ativan, Topamax & Cymbalta everyday, so I'm not really sure how any of my brain cells actually manage to work together. #drugs #dumb
Casually lying in a sea of lozenge wrappers.
prescribed to adderall AND vyvanse now hell yeah.
Where's my fuckin' prozac?
Vyvanse are my bestest friend
It feels like we're all living in a Prozac nation, the United States of depression
@FlopFlippity we did the trial and error. I'm running out of options. They tried this with the enbrel too
@HVBookthongs I have continual pain in my feet. I am on Lyrica and Cymbalta but have to take hydrocodone at bedtime or awake all night. :-((
@Orange_Lillies man oh man, I feel for ya. Do they say that if u take a break from Enbrel that it might be effective again later on?
the Seroquel is definitely causing this restlessness i'm experiencing #jitters
Not taking vyvanse after 3 weeks of taking it is like waking up in a Katy perry video. Cotton candy, fireworks, sunshine & whipcream evrywhr
Jesus be a throat lozenge!!!!!
Developing ADD in my 20s thanks to the memory/attention-killing lamictal I've been on since my early teens. #bipolar #morepillsmoreproblems
Just took my last vyvanse. Can't get my prescription filled for the next 3 days. This may or may not end up well...
Time Negrita Sunrise con Prozac.
Today, the only thing I'm thankful for is vyvanse.
See Rheumy today. 3 month check up. My pred is down to 2 1/2. Still on Enbrel & MTX. Wrists hurt more since lowed pred.
"How do u do it? U got me losing every breath. What did u give me to make my heart beat out my chest?" #vyvanse

@chaiwatnitch oh hi dude.. Got a sore throat? Have a lozenge to calm your throat dude..
@DarksideDamien How ya doing, off the prozac. I'm not too bad, about 3 wks now.
My cat won't stop screeching the "Rains of Castamere". She needs prozac badly @PayPal can you fasttrack my money at ALL??? #DepressedCat
@RA_Guy congrats!!! what has worked??? I am same now with Humira. No pain AFTER walking either and can turn over in bed without pain!
My vyvanse is kicking in. I can feel it.
Why does the teen angst in The Cure songs make me want to shout, "Go take a Prozac!" Ohhhh I'm gettin old!!!
I need food. I'm cranky when I'm hungry. Food is my Prozac sometimes. Ok. Most of the time.
@INukeYou Have you tried taking meds? That's what I've had to do. I take trazodone now, but it may be more for mental issues. Not sure.
@itsmeh8 Trazodone is sometimes prescribed for sleep :)
This kitchen Nightmares in Insane! Bitch needs Prozac
But it's trippy cuz people will rather be a Prozac Head then a Pot Head...
Seroquel. "@Gemini_Minx: Why in the hell do people keep crashing their cars into buildings?! Good lord."

Warning: Trazodone will show a false positive for ecstasy.
@BuzzFeedAndrew When will the madness end?!? PROZAC FOR EVERYONE!
@IntervalThinks @newscientist Give them Prozac - not!
Just heard a great debate on #remicade from #ddw but now im just more unsure if i should stay on #humira... #crohnsProblems
"@hussainshah786: @d_hablo yh prozac n ecstasy block neuron pathways or some shit" Thats liveeeeee
@PreciousThing I just had a look buddy, and my medication (Seroquel) does affect tolerance to the sun.
*Rivaroxaban. Aches get bad from 2pm onwards. Therefore seems unlikely to be side-effect.
Putting things off until you get your Vyvanse.
i'm going to try and quit my paxil cold turkey just like i always do with medicine that stops working. i started today.
@lindlpt I just found out that have osteopenia I'm taking Boniva once a month
I wonder what graduation rates would be if vyvanse and redbull were never invented. #probablyawful
Dammit. Lost track of my mess. Anticonvulsants: plenty. Pantoprazole: running out. Fluoxetine: run out. WTF? Calling doc today.
@dogbook My Dad's Havanese is in love with Chopper the cutie from the Cymbalta and Travelers' ads she barks, sits up and nudges the tv
Seriously if you are getting off cymbalta tape alot if movies I was up till 4 and feel and look like a zombie just to tired to growl !!!
this vyvanse straight fucked me up today
@accordingtoxen I'm gonna need some cymbalta Lol
@jennyelliott88 very true. Maybe you might need a higher dose of the #humira like 2 shots or even a different #biological drug?!
Man vyvanse gets me thru days. Need to be prescribed to this shit.
Prozac is my best friend right now
@GodOfIlluminati the drugs are what cause calcification. Especially flouride. Prozac is half fluoride by weight.
Thursday my husbands first day of quit smoking with the nicotrol inhaler from the doctor. Wish him luck
Lately, I've lived off alcohol and vyvanse.
@dedemarieex3: #MyBoyfriendNotAllowedTo "vent" to other female ? wtf she aint dr.phil nor a therapist ? depressed ? get cymbalta."”
all that we were is wrapped in a shroud of fluoxetine memories
It's like, do I take a nap or do I take q vyvanse
@neurobonkers also, "meth mouth" is really poverty mouth. u don't c when people take it for ADHD. nor in Prozac, which similarly dries mouth
@heidi_viljoen ....i know....i think the world needs a little prozac in the drinking water...:-)
“@Clarbini: Would it be a bad idea to take trazodone now?” Omg yes
woooo finally got my vyvanse prescription refilled #focusfocusfocus #nowicanactlikeanormalhuman
Cleaned my house. Thanks vyvanse :)
@weird_prophet Only if I can blame Lamictal, Prozac and Klonopin for all of my tweets.
i was gonna start working out but then my doctor put me back on vyvanse life is awesome
Restless Leg Syndrome is bad tonight. Damn you fluoxetine.
Cymbalta commercials... Where the side effects are longer than the actual advertisement
Vyvanse is wearing off and I still have another chapter to do. #itsgonnabealongnight
*guy walks out of pharmacy with drug bag* me: "what drug do you think he's on mom??" mom: "well he's talking to himself." me: "Seroquel XR"
You can have all the papers, articles etc about #Pradaxa but until there is an antidote, this drug is a killer. #RECALLPRADAXA
@DanKennedy_NYC hmmm... I don't know. I'm more of a hypersomniac. have you tried meditation? warm bath? chamomile tea? hypnosis? trazodone?
I think baclofen might make me a bigger asshole than usual. :/
Effexor, i hate you.
@marcmaron is it okay to drink coffee whilst sucking on a nicotine lozenge?
A horse walks into a bar and asks for a throat lozenge.
Quitting smoking would be way easier if they made reality less frustrating. Insanity is the new Paxil.
It's Humira night! 
Seriously haven't ate one thing ALL damn day.. #vyvanse #add #damn
Nothing rhymes with 'orange.' Unless, of course, you're rapping: forage, horrid, courage, lozenge, porridge, portage, storage...
I missed my Vyvanse. 
i need a throat lozenge from yelling at @LizzyKlein23
Also despise Humira commercials during dinner time. Makes me want to throw the TV out the window. #lupus #rheum #biologics #epicfail
If Cymbalta actually worked for a black mans depression.
@fragileannie omg!what did they put you on something like risperadal, zyprexa or even worse.. clozaril?
I hate when my vyvanse wears off because I can't remember any of the cool shit I wanted to do earlier.
I love the Humira commercials because I love to say "adalimumab" yeah.
@DeanMikel I'm not lazy!! My seroquel knocked me out!!
can't even enjoy this banana right now because of fuckin vyvanse what is life
I'm the lozenge that Gotham deserves... (Read in Batman voice.)
Drugs in the fluoroquinolone class:ciprofloxacin, gatifloxacin, gemifloxacin, levofloxacin, moxifloxacin & norfloxacin; risk for kidney pbms
Is it objective, that is, does it refer to apples, health and a half hours. I'm not even on any vyvanse! #swag
@FMAB_Pride @CrazyKidWrath_ // .... Cymbalta can help.
I hate when I take vyvanse on days that I have nothing to concentrate on cause then I'm just forced to think about how messed up my life is
Idk wtf #Humira is but basically if you take it you're going to die
Adam and Juliana are leaving me for 43 days take me with youuuu! I need Cymbalta #depressionhurts
Humira is a bitch!! It better work on me!_
depression hurts cymbalta can help
I take vyvanse and continuously listen to vocal trance mixes
@mattcavallo blog 1st step, could be POSTER CHILD for Ampyra AND maybe Biogen (anaphylactic shock from Tysabri, BUT now started Tecfidera
#indirectyourex you still owe me $5 for that vyvanse I gave you for free
This vyvanse is keeping me up tho but I want to sleep
What's people's opinion on their use or knowledge of Cymbalta. Want to know before I start taking it.
@jimcallisBA @texanfan2785 what college kid isn't on that or Vyvanse
If you bake the Effexor into almond-blackberry granola it gets exactly 0 times more potent.
This stuff is like natural & healthy vyvanse.......
@upasbook Great read as always. I was on Cymbalta for 5 days. Cold turkey had sweats, migraine, tremors while on & 3 days after.
I NEED TO START TAKING MY VIIBRYD AGAIN BUT IT MAKES ME FEEL SO NAUSEOUS UGHHH
Just took seroquel. Now I'm freaking out that I will end up sleeping 15 hrs and miss my 12pm appt tomorrow
No one likes me on my Vyvanse #TooChill #Zombiemode
Kinda want to be a movie star, but I'd settle for being in a Cymbalta commercial or something.
@_royalbitch well, I don't like it, at all. so, ima take this last vyvanse I have then ima quit.
@SassyPharmD It's Viibryd. I can't afford it so I get samples from my psych and we had to bump my appt.
@LeBatardShow look up prolia commercial. It is for post-menopausal osteoporosis. The warnings say don't take if you're pregnant.
Cymbalta can help #subtweet
#Tips. Sodium alendronate belongs to the subgroup of nitrogen-containing bisphosphonates; it acts as a potent inhibitor of osteoclast.
"Slow down, you sound like the end of a Cymbalta commercial." - Lucille Bluth
@SassyPharmD Definitely combos. Right now I'm on Lamictal, Abilify (samples on that one, too) and Viibryd.
@Jenndola If you're on brand lamictal, I know they have one, and Abilify too.
Trazadone can do wonders.
Fword, super glad I didnt take Pradaxa.
bury me in a bathtub filled with Paxil
Do I feel weak because of running out of Symbicort 400/12, because of strenuous gardening, or because of Rivaroxaban (Xarelto)?
@ctr1945 my mom used Rivaroxaban and it gave her a terrible time with weakness and muscle pain.
@Azlemed I was on Olanzapine last year.
I'm taking seroquel and prosom. If I die in my sleep it was my doctor's fault for telling me to do it.
I guess that vyvanse want a good idea I just want to sleeeeep
Trazadone down the pipe lmao
.@GovTookMyRights @LUpthegrove Clearly she's taken a few Paxil with a few bottle of Napa merlot.
@nikkimarieeeee lucky bitch i took vyvanse today as it makes me not eat i just wanna be able to wanna eat ugh
@itwasntbay yeah when I take vyvanse any food just looks/sounds/tastes fucking disgusting
I guess this is what I get for doubling my vyvanse #nosleep
Quetiapine - I slept!! Weirdo dreams and very drowsy this morning but I slept!!!
@bella_blakefan @iamyourtoni it is weird how they lose their effectiveness..seen that too..my sis swears by something called trazadone (sp.)
I'm up like I don't have an EOC in the am...but that's what vyvanse is for lol.
They ingest Ambien, Seroquel, LSD, Adderall, Oxycodone, cocaine, Flexeril, Percocet, psilocybin mushrooms and codeine. 1/3 #taipei
@wenbellings prescription, I have zoplicone, nice and gentle but work. I have Zometa to keep the bones strong and control the tumours
@K_Mowers mdd or bipolar for me too. Had 1 serious episode of mania. Depressed all the other time. Effexor is really working for me now.
I can't seem to shake this uneasy feeling. I hope it is just because I'm so tired....or maybe cause I'm out of Paxil.....
@sto_plc Baclofen 10mg out of stock and Pharmacy staff have no idea when it’ll be available! Oh wait! Lets pause patient’s illness. #Fail
The only reason I will be surviving tomorrow is because of Vyvanse.
On expectorant and Ciprofloxacin. Wish me get better to join 10k #HaloFitRun this Sun, 9-Jun
Free 80mg vyvanse from my dads employee for this long day lol #thanks
@Zymymar it seems to be having an effect already. Took Zoloft in 2000, and Effexor XR in 2006-2008. This was my specific choice.
@Azlemed first two weeks of olanzapine v drowsy. weight gain was an issue. Great for my anxiety though.
Medication side-affects have hit me hard today: I keep on randomly jolting or rocking, it is so bad I am finding it hard to type! #Seroquel

Vyvanse saving my life

@AnthonyCumia #Zimmerman was removed from Vyvanse for mood swings before he was put on Adderall See Med report: pic.twitter.com/4QQroTmzIE
@Fatuglyew thing about venlafaxine is the withdrawals when you're late for a dose - it's like electric shocks in your brain, and they go -
“@UberFacts: There are no words in the English language that rhyme with purple, orange, silver or month.” lozenge rhymes with orange
@rbiom fair enough mate, I'd never heard lozenge before haha
Every time I take vyvanse to be productive I just end up sitting on tumblr and twitter all day.

@catch_n_reLISE Not sure what antibiotic that was in the pic (maybe Bactrim??), but dairy products reduce the efficacy of ciprofloxacin
I need cymbalta. DEPRESSION HURTS
the leprechauns have been stealing my nicotine lozenges...I'm sure of it!
@garymlasasso thank you. She's on keppra and vigabatrin at the minute.
@jenchang1 I think patients who take Tysabri generally want to know if they could be at risk for PML.
@OCDsuffererUK because if you have a heart problem you can't have quetiapine so try have to check just to make sure :)
WOOT! MT @addyeB OB&psych cleared me for BFing while on Prozac&Lamictal! VERY happy about this. Was hoping I’d at least get to try. #Bipolar
@upasbook So sorry that Cymbalta really threw you a curve. Well that it has made life worse. Glad to hear your daughter is close by.
@crescentcolours I remember that quetiapine feeling well x
@ladyleyli well there are the biologics out there for example #remiccade or #humira which i'm on

@drinksinthedark I've taken Citalopram before. How long have you been taking it? I think a GP unlikely to prescribe Quetiapine.
Wanted to catch some rays in next few days b4 humira comes back but dont think gonna happen!
Humira shot done - hopefully a lifesaver
@Vicksy_D why before Humira?
@benderbach cause humira gives me a lot of rashes and like most of these drugs.. Skin sensitivity happens
OMGGG .. thought i ran out of vyvanse but i just found my last one .. thank the lord !!! looks like ill be on a cleaning frenzy after all (;
I'm taking a small dosage of Risperidone and Fluoxetine every night..I'm really scared it's gonna make me fat? HELP!?
If you were JC + Did your neurology team suggest you stop Tysabri or ask you to continue treatment ?
@grandmanana1952 Thanks so much for asking. You're so sweet. I've been okay. Switched to Enbrel a mth ago & doing better! How've u been?

@pensreport @penguinkitty87 I was allergic to it, I take Cymbalta
@Kirkby007 I had a gene test for Tysabri I guess it can cause a fatal brain disorder. My chances are low.. But that crap is creepy.
@jen_hintz I'll wait until my next dose of the meds and take my trazodone and hopefully sleep through it. Rain is coming tho. ugh
Fuck Paxil. I never want to take this shit again, but every time I try I get ridiculously sick. My life suckssss.
@Farfbaz let the benadryl spread thru your system then I start the remicade. Always hated the infusion process. Enbrel is better 4 me

Hi twitter! I slept really well last night and I think it's seroquel's fault ^_^
I just slept 9 hours!!! #quetiapine loving this :)
Upped my Effexor dosage 5 days ago. Sleep cycle and quality went to shit 4 days ago. I sense a correlation here...
The Xarelto commercial during the Today Show is the highlight of my morning.
@WK_Echo as far as I'm concerned, Pradaxa, Xarelto, & Eliquis are all the devil
anyone have adderall or vyvanse they wanna give me?
@Modysoul I was on both the Cymbalta & Prozac teams when I worked for Lilly. I'm pretty sure I've taken so much Prozac I own the patent.
I shouldn't tweet on vyvanse it's going to be extremely negative lol
People taking #quetiapine - does this need to sleep 24/7 go eventually? Cos this is not sustainable beyond the short term.
@xxSarriexx nope! For some reason it's 1 tablet 3 times a day... And 150mg venlafaxine xr in the morning. Xx
But still Dr. Maria Jasinskas was right & would have been if not for Pharmacy; She said, "You know sometimes Vyvanse can make you depressed"
Taking a 60mg vyvanse was pointless for a 90 minute test...

@daveanthony My dad sang Cat Scratch Fever almost everyday, always on about 2500 mg of Effexor. Glad to know you.
@Kirkby007 I believe that one is Tysabri. I was told same about Humira and cimzia so not sure what will happen.
T.O just took one of my vyvanse, game over
Once the lozenge puts the cough to rest. Peroxide in my fuckin' chest. A dollop in the water and I'm dropping into consciousness.
Surprising mom with a clean house when she gets home from work because VYVANSE!
@Dr_Abdouli it's safer to go with what he said so baclofen. I'll email him tomorrow and update you on what he'll say just to double check!!
When my brother doesn't have his vyvanse <<<
@JustMumBlog My thyroid is a-okay. I have sacroiliitis, and am being put on Humira, if they give it to me for free. :)
Either I'm exhausted or this Paxil is working WONDERS cuz I ain't mad about shit
@L0stAl0ne hace you trucos seroquel or fluvoxamine? Those are the ones that had helped me better and also if you think that you are in..
@hwise29 Yikes! I can usually fight Adderall/Vyvanse dehydration with water, but it's trickier when you're drinking your stimulants.
The Fluoroquinolone Syndrome <-Have you experienced side effects from taking Quinolones antibiotics (e.g. Cipro) ?
@DanDavymusic @daulpavy you need to suck on a lozenge!!! Xx
This cymbalta commercial on tv right now lmaooo like all they're advertising are the side effects and people still don't care * sigh*
“@EMauraA: @VestDennis So true - ALL the time! I see commercials for Pradaxa lawsuits already. Agreed they SELL u on NEW IMPROVED.
@charlienicola85 someones said can happen while fighting infection which is quite possible,nearly finished some cipro&bringing up foul gunk!
@96_miyuki D: do you need a lozenge? or maybe drink lukewarm water?
I tried to think of the cold rain as a minty lozenge for the skin but it didn't work and now if you're not careful I will cry on you.
oh hello seroquel old friend I mi*passes out on bed*
@ncbi_pubmed I have read over 2500 journal abstracts and titles on Pubmed website on the antipsychotic I take namely olanzapine

Depression hurts.. Cymbalta can help!!

@sometimesiswirl not at all! I'm an open book. Paxil, klonopin and Xanax
My docs holdin out on the good stuff smh nigga put me on Strattera instead of Vyvanse or Adderall & Buspirone instead of Xanax #FUCKYOUTOO
“@_TheCuttingEdge: .... depression hurts” cymbalta can help
@hello_nacho @tobiasampersand Lexapro gave me the worst mixed episodes. I have some instability with Pristiq but I can manage it ok.
and I'm not even under the influence of any substance (except my homie Paxil)
@hello_nacho @tobiasampersand I'm with you. Even though the Pristiq works, I still don't feel fully human.
Gin and Paxil
Seroquel hit me so I can go to sleep.
@Camiliasilf yeouch. At the seroquel. I can't tolerate it, hypersensitive to most meds..
Oops, sorry for all of that. Here, have a picture of some uplifting messages on lozenge wrappers. pic.twitter.com/pNiEkLN1GJ

Eating a Peppermint lozenge & Drinking A Glass Of Cold Water, Coolest Feeling Ever!!
@Mannypresh602 word. I've been fuckin tweakin out on vyvanse and writing hella verses
@kevinmu03071266 I was on the lamotrigine for a while, the levetricetan is for me, stops the jerks I got . How long have you been on it?
When 97% of your drugs ad is a list side effects it's not even fun to make fun of anymore. #cymbalta #DepressionIsNoLaughingMatter.
@smittenkitten .. the lamotrigine is off label. but i'm seriously not getting another damn thing from them.
Royalty Pharma hikes hostile #Elan offer to USD 13 per share- as predicted. And adds a USD 2.50 Tysabri CVR. Game changer?

“@sglovesmb: @ChillTFOut_ screw cymbalta” exactly.

Mortality benefit for CHF is with ACEI or ARBs, beta blockers (carvedilol and Metoprolol) and spironolactone. #CHF
Am I the only one that grinds the shit out of their teeth on vyvanse? #cantbetheonlyone #icouldstudyforfinalsidonthave
Offered me a lozenge.
? From an #crohnie: have any of u experienced weight gain on humira? And why? Notice u eat more or eat the same but just gaining weight?
Gonna ask to return to Lexapro bc Cymbalta not workin, also bc busking profits plummeted when I could no longer play crotch like steel drum
Rivaroxaban's people seem to market the multiple indications angle. Apixaban's designed the bravest trial. Let's get it done!
Its been so long that if I took one of my vyvanse right now id be up for two days
#FF RT @LisaGoodwin1 I'm gonna take Cymbalta just for the side effects.

I need cymbalta
@chroniccurve Also I just saw a Humira commercial with a 35 year old mom baking, brushing teeth, and playing w/ kids - they're listening!
There are only two medications FDA-approved for PTSD–Zoloft (sertraline) and Paxil (paroxetine). Recent report
Moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis must be an epidemic b/c I've seen the Humira drug commercial so many times I can recite it verbatim
@bettieriot I'm not sure my lack of planning would be considered an emergency, it is my (friend's) own fault. It's taking venlafaxine that
@bettieriot and paroxetine now than theyh were then.
@incurablehippie I rarely see paroxetine used now but venlafaxine is quite prevalent.
5 hours til I forgo my nightly 300mg Seroquel XR. Get ready for the crazy.
@RecoveryDiaries yepp im on fluoxetine and i still drink, i hit a bit of a low a couple of days later..but tend to be okay
This vyvanse is amazing!!! Fuck adderal
I hope every1 has an awesome weekend and stay dry (if ur on the east coast)... #crohns #ibd #humira #crohnsFamily
Don't EVER brush your teeth and follow it up with a cherry lozenge. 
Shorter Xarelto advertisement. If you take this pill, you may bleed to death.
The #Quetiapine is kicking in. Bizarre thoughts tonight. Tempted to take the whole lot. I won't - don't worry people. Just odd thoughts.
Jonathan Grey must be on Vyvanse this game. Dude is throwin smoke
@MrCreations_ smokin nd sleeping #Seroquel
@1D_Amore @miafierro stfu!! Lol whatever cymbalta.
@Ysabel_03 @bofier try something like wellbutrin - there are many better than zoloft (zombie-loft) and paxil for anxiety imo
Should've sold my vyvanse to these ACT takers.
@ValBazaldua YOU'RE SO BASIC YOU NEED MY CYMBALTA.. Hm, ever tried meth?
06.07 on top of everything else, I'm getting a summer cold, sneezing and blocked but runny nose. Some medications interact with Rivaroxaban.
So unfair, I never get the good side effects of meds. Ativan, Seroquel, & Ambien XR make me feel so drink I cant really walk & Im nauseated
@hotandhumid when I got Humira they sent me a box of them, same with b12,and when they did home health care infusions.
I couldn't watch this movie & understand it if I was alert & on my vyvanse. So I don't stand a chance in hell now.

@xNicoleJadex ive taken in the last 24 hours 800 mgs of seroquel and at least 15 of valium... i napped some
@Camiliasilf That's a lot of seroquel! Isn't it less sedating at that high a dose?
@ZoeySpark77 @VampiRPh the traz may be a good option. Temazepam and ambien doesn't work for me. Seroquel IR is my current best option
@Dan_Dickerson ~ Sorry to bring this up again; Can u do something about Price eating on air? Maybe it's a throat lozenge? Still annoying.
@HurtBlogger I'm right there with you with awful pain & stiffness. Humira Mtx & Plaquenil aren't working today #rheum

I wish there was a Vyvanse's Day so I could show Vyvanse how much it means to me.
Thank god for vyvanse 
@Jake_Anderson44 you are not triply from vyvanse you dumbass.

Not meant to drink while on fluoxetine but fuck it yoloswag. Just kidding. Don't do that. FUCK SWAG.
Yea. I forgot you aren't suppose to drink if you take vyvanse. Explains a little bit
I swear thia cymbalta is causing me to have horrible nightmares!
Is it hot in here or is my Vyvanse just kicking in?
This higher dose of #cymbalta is making me extremely tired and anxious. Is this normal?
@DnnyLndn thanks, I decided to go back on olanzapine after trying aripiprazole for a few days, can you tolerate aripiprazole ok I hope

@MissADDcanada I almost switched to vyvanse, but my doctor & I decided that since I'm already used to the Adderall (& it's working well),
“@SpontaneousNat: “@doniqueD: *coughs ridiculously over the TL*” you want some lozenge” no I'm cool *coughs*
“@doniqueD: “@SpontaneousNat: “@doniqueD: *coughs ridiculously over the TL*” you want some lozenge” no I'm cool *coughs*” Okay ooh
Spent the whole day running around town and only had to stop once for a pee/Vyvanse break,

3 Norcos and a seroquel had that answer.
However I do love my #paxil my dreams have been all over the place since I've been on it!

20.12 day 15 rivaroxaban diary. Haven't yet taken today's tablet. Will when I eat. Still intense lower back pain from yesterday's tablet.
Goodnight all, Quetiapine, Temazepam, Epilim, Tegretol & Co-Codomol are all meeting in my head. Wish me luck! ;-)
@dpatrickg I mean he does have joint pain. Humira (r)
Major adverse effect of Cipro in pts 18 and under? #drugtrivia
Getting a seven page text of garbled ramblings from someone detailing that their titrating of venlafaxine led to a break up is unusual.
So I'm eating a throat lozenge and then I realise it tastes like something familiar. Then I remember @NontzMkhize's bounce juice!

@thinwrists I'm sure she didn't mean to make everyone worry like this :( sorry. I know she took a mixture the main one was the quetiapine
@CheetahHeel @AmandaBynes take the goddamn Zyprexa you crazy fuck the Internet doesn't love you it loves train wrecks call your parents fuck
@fasterbonniekat I'm not sure. Took Effexor and then Celexa before this stuff.
When prolia and balmex for adults are the products marketed at you on TV and on the net, it's time to make some changes.

Sometimes I hate that I'm not as antisocial as I used to be. Damn Paxil, #whycantiquityou.
Gimme one reason why I shouldn't have sex drive / libido. I accept this as a part of withdrawal symptoms from Venlafaxine. :O
I think my iTunes may need a Paxil.
@andrealpike The Cipro is just for later, in case we get sick/infection from water /food.
I love fluoxetine...
@SKDNY I'm having great time really needed this.Ive reduced to 25mg weekly & still working really hope Humira starts 2 work 4 u soon hugs x
oh shit i forgot to take my seroquel is it even worth it to go back downstairs to take it....
@LISABROWNPHOTOS Consider yourself lucky if all it does is make you dizzy and sick! Cipro crippled me and countless others.
That enbrel must be working real nice for Mickelson
@QuiteColdNight @BuzzFeedAndrew USPS employees who were given Cipro ended up crippled by it & filed a class action lawsuit against Bayer.

@JoeC Second day off Effexor & on Viibryd here. Brain zaps are fun. And by fun, I mean horrendous & miserable.
Whenever you see Phil Mickelsen, take a shot of Enbrel

Phil Mickelson is looking pretty good today. He must be filming his next Enbrel commercial. #usopen #arthritis
I need lots and lots of Levofloxacin! I'll overdose myself today just to feel better.
@eloisethepug ask for extra chemicals when they clean. And take a few cipro to make sure all is covered.
Just saw the Enbrel commercial. Which one of those kids is carrying Phil's beans?
@Privacy625 yup. They used to give Seroquel to the elderly until it was discovered that if doubled mortality. That means people died.
So my cough is now so bad I can hardly keep a sore throat lozenge in.
@I_am_Heather I do that on fluoxetine & diazepam on a daily basis :) @deanoshoes
*I am worried that Phil Mickelson might overdose on Enbrel if he blows another #USopen
I'll go untreated for 8 weeks! That is extremely scary, if I wasn't on Effexor and Ativan I would be having panic attacks..thank God no pain
Dear ciprofloxacin, i count on you :(
@SaraSmyly I take seroquel too! I used to take Klonopin but I switched to Xanax and then to Ativan
@Gatorguy you can get humira thru the medicine company for free. think its by abbott. I did a few yrs ago when I lost my health insurance.

Rivaroxaban 2/2 lower back pain. Not very PC but am crippled by this drug. Taking more paracetamols. Must ring for 'phone consultation.

@AmyBadkin @Kate24Hrs_aDay not to worry - just a bit of temporary fuzziness. I've been on Humira since 2007 & love it.
@SKRDad it's all about the long view, right? Humira has side effects for a few days, but totally worth it!
@ElectroSocket I was on enbrel for 8 years have since developed neuro problems (ataxia) wish id never taken it side effects not worth risks
Erm my pdoc wants me to go back on quetiapine. Pointed out it had caused a heart arrhythmia last time. Going back to GP to look at my ECG
@tasteandjustice oh no way to that. paxil has been the only med that has worked for me so far

60 mg fluoxetine
Throat Lozenge
@tllanes My nighttime med is Trazodone and I cut back to a generic, OTC for my acid but it is a sad night if I don't take it.
Rivaroxaban diary day 22. Last tablet taken Tuesday 18th, 4 days ago. Woken up in pain. Bad fluid retention (uneven) on both legs.
Rivaroxaban diary day 22 Had bloods taken on 20th. Go back to Flec, simvastatin, doxazosin, furesomide an asthma inhalers. Then add 1 drug
All these years and nobody thought to offer batman a throat lozenge??
Rivaroxaban diary day 22 then add 1 drug at a time at weekly intervals. Surely easiest way to lower BP is to lose weight.
if i take seroquel with hydrocodone, will i die?
This seroquel got me lo0o0py as helll. This status took me at least thirty minutes to type I keep waking up without knowing I feel asleep
Rivaroxaban diary day 22. Am beginning to think all pains from pressure on that part of body are due to fluid retention.
@TabbyDarling I have multiple health issues and disorders: Lamictal,Lisinopril,Strattera,Buspar,Risperdol,Trazadone,Corig,Cogenton,Klonopin
Grandpa thinks Batman could use a throat lozenge. Lol gramps. Lol.
I reckon I have drug-induced oedema causing musculo-skeletal pain. Likely drug combination: Rivaroxaban, Losartan, and Simvastatin.
every personality trait you have is a psychiatric disorder here take some zyprexa
Does fluoxetine even work. Maybe I should go back to it.

@Sarahdgaf13 which one is it? I'm starting humira for the second time
@Sarahdgaf13 ohh man I've never heard of it. I was on humira for 3 years and it worked really well.
@AlpacaQueen77 (and don't think I'm dismissing that anxiety, either. Anxiety is awful awful awful. I get that too and take paxil for it.)
@amaditalks @argylestyle Except for the Boniva commercial.
@LesterHoltNBC that menopause drug is similar to Paxil that has been linked to disc degeneration. Bone issues are an effect of menopause.
@503Kevinsito look up "sertraline" and "trazodone" if you want them, have them. They're pretty shitty for "recreational" use lol JS

I keep seeing humira commercials curing new things each time.
I DON'T WANT TO TAKE MY HUMIRA AT ALL THE PAIN IS ALWAYS UNBEARABLE AND I DON'T WANNA
I don't get how my doctor recommended me humira when the fucking side affects are worst than what I already have, "may cause cancer"
I suggest never stop taking Effexor abruptly because you will feel like you're on your death bed
Duloxetine
No pain is worse than Humira. Not even arthritis. Lmfao.
Can't sleep. Shouldn't have had that smoothie made of coffee beans, fluoxetine, Red Bull and 1500 manly push-ups before bed.
Lester Holt NBC just hyped a "new drug" for hot flashes; not a new drug, it is simply paroxetine rebranded. NBC needs new science editor!
@LesterHoltNBC. Paroxetine for hot flashes not a "new drug", only rebranded by Pfizer in a new dose form. Get a new science editor!
one of the things i hate most about quetiapine is when i take it for the first few hours i slur my words, so people assume i'm merely drunk.
@jscottamy I think #Dexter needs a couple of those Paxil tonight!
When I had my infected K stone, hospital put me on Cipro - a synthetic antibiotic. I "smelled" a pungent solvent odor, I smell it now. Why?
@Kirkby007 #hcsm I start #Chemo on Tues b/c of #humira so I know. It helped but it then destroyed my lungs.
Fill up the Paxil because life is going to be really sad
so.. the humira commercial said "i went to my dermatologists & she assigned me humira." i said "Y didn't she give it 2 U in the 1st place?"
Zoloft was just as bad as Effexor. It made me more depressed and more suicidal. I don't want it.
@911_redhead I can’t have triptans, so, caffeine and Tylenol and a long nap if possible. (Namenda and Neurontin are my daily prophylactics.)

Fucking Effexor withdrawals. I would shake my fist but I don't have the energy.
Its so hard to believe I've been on #Paroxetine for a year already. It has helped a lot with the panic attacks. Not so much with depression.
i like myself. i love my clothes. i do not have low self esteem. paxil might of helped. haha
Sooooooo is it too awkward to ask if anyone wants to buy any trazodone?
Maybe I just won't sleep tonight or maybe I'll take quetiapine and sleep for 14 hours looks like I'm gonna flip a coin

Oh, and I forgot that with Lamotrigine come awful night terrors. I woke up no fewer than five times screaming and sweaty. #lol
