Seroquel gives me nightmares every fucking night but I take it anyway
@chrisschnapp chemically, illnesses like these are of the brain itself. behavioral medication like zoloft, paxil, etc exist for this reason.

@willentrekin I had a physician comment it would be better for my seizures if I lived in a medical m. state instead of the lamictal.
Paxil withdrawal is nasty. Do not like.
Trazodone is no joke. Slept through every alarm.
How could poppies & wild lettuce & things be any worse than Cymbalta? Only difference is Cymbalta is "socially & governmentally sanctioned".
@valcolvin802 @mrs_sb @sisternavy @clairemullen35 haha wouldn't go that far think I need some baclofen after my workout today xx
@JustmeLeah_blog I was on that for years and it didn't help me much. Same as fluoxetine, effexor, seroxat. None made much difference.

@annaspargoryan benzos don't work for me & I've had a cracker of a panic attack on seroquel. listening to people chat on podcasts helps me.
That's the same for me, Lamotrigine is brilliant for me.
@rare_basement have you tried a different sleeping med? Maybe an ssri like trazodone - no crazy side effects and less tolerance buildup.
Anwaar just said this out of nowhere, what a freaking weirdo - "depression can hurt, cymbalta can help". @AnwaaraNuwara
@anxietyfighter suffered social anxiety for 4 yrs when i had my first panic attack,got worse when i went to uni, so have just started paxil
Tysabri set to be a treatment for spms if trials prove effective and at least 3 desperate stem cell trials going on. Incredible work!
@purplepersonage I understand. And there's always the quetiapine excuse too. It's a real side-effect, but I also use it to soothe my guilt.
Exclusion hurts. Cymbalta can help.
Trouble in math? Cymbalta can help

Olanzapine together. Olanzapine is causing me to gain weight because I binge eat on it, normally in the evening. Also sick of the joint pain
I have never had any really dangerous or very unpleasant physical side effects from Prozac or olanzapine when taken alone, nor when taken
Does anyone know if the weight gain is less than #olanzapine alone if you combine it with #wellbutrin ?
@lavenderfuchsia I lost weight in the past but it was much easier. Like 2 steps forward, one step back on the quetiapine.
Is Cymbalta an antidepressant or medication for rheumatoid arthritis?

Does anyone happen to know if Lamictal causes you to feel hot? @liberonetwork @_Sabiiiiii #cantstopsweating
@jameswanko *gives you a throat lozenge*
SO IT FUCKING TURNS OUT THAT A SIDE EFFECT OF EFFEXOR IS A LOSS OF APPETITE
I send @LockJohnson a legit business question. He replies w/ the personification of Zoloft & Zyprexa
Not that anyone noticed, but my #ambienwithdrawl only lasted a few days. Why? Because I got another scrip. I need it while I'm on Levaquin.
@BobbieCasteel took perocet, naproxen, namenda, topamax, cymbalta. Plus heat on back earlier used tens unit & lidocaine cream
Not being able to sleep after you've taken trazadone because you can't breathe through your nose #allergies #storyofmylife #sniffles
Depression hurts, Cymbalta will help
Sad Depressed In need of cymbalta
Tysabri infusion #54 yesterday. Made me feel tired and out of it for a while. Maybe it's the heat - 34C (94F)!!! Maybe a VERY HOT summer?
Ok this new Twitter client behaves like an ex of mine. Sporadic and off the Paxil..in an instant. YOWZA
@naughtmyself Depression and I have some obsessive compulsive tendencies. The generic Effexor that I take can be used for anxiety as well.
#download Avelox - A Medical Dictionary, Bibliography, and Annotated Research Guide to Internet References - ICON Health... @WorkshopGuides
@stacymadern thats the prob with Zyprexa its for ppl with Bi-Polar or Schizophrenia its really strong when you wake up your drowsy for 6 hrs
You woukd think going off of cymbalta would make me less tired...but nope...-_-
i think i'd be a pretty cool girlfriend because i'd share good music with you, tolerate your crap, and treat your dick like a lozenge
@josielawrence1 @openspacer @lee_simpson1971 Also, who kept coughing? Take a lozenge next time honestly some people.
Took a trazodone without a splash of vodka and now I'm worried that it won't work.
@CandidlyKelly yes last year I went and got lamictal it was like 3 bucks... this most recent time it was 22 dollars for a bottle of 50mg D:

@TheMcCuntface all the effort and passion in the world is nt enough. Paxil patients r suffering from a giant hole ripped in their soul.
@SinaAmedson That one is also on my list!! And "lozenge"
@Fox1985 Cipro can permanently damage ALL tendons in the body. If you enjoy being able to walk, you need to find a safer antibiotic!
@Gscott7 I'm over my lozenge limit for the next 4 hours lol. Abbiegail is here now and I have to whisper. She finds it hilarious
@secretsufferer Olanzapine. I was taking 7.5mg and that was a nightmare, now taking 5mg but the weight still keeps coming :(
@lodaox How long have you been on Tysabri? Do you know your JCV status? Did all this happen while on Ty (bad MRIs etc)?
Cymbalta may cause*dead voice-reads fast* dryness,redness of the eye and burnin in the anus.ppl consult with ur doctor before takin cymbalta
Cannot believe you recommend Fosamax after proven bad side effects. Stopped using it years ago.very disappointed.
@GardenVibe also the #antibiotic Levaquin will create a situation for tendons to rupture more easily.
Nikkas dyin wish is a throat lozenge
#asco13 for@ccalliance Dr. Dy at JHU pain mgmt, duloxetine very little success in peripheral neuropathy do 2 side effects some have min bene

@mannisandhu it's always better to have a lozenge with the medication, coats the back of your throat. #BootsEmployee.
@cfoleyy that's what Cymbalta is for
Suspicious of my medical health. I'm on the highest dose of Paxil, but it only works if i get good sleep. I want off meds.
id get back on prozac just for the weight loss
Love Radio boards! "Could Atlanta provide Nash FMs afternoon jock in WI a throat lozenge".
@SeraRavi also, a free trial of Cymbalta
In depression.... Cymbalta could help 
Lamotrigine may be of interest for both prevention and treatment of brain metastases of HER2+ breast cancer.
@BipolarProbzz I'm on Lamotrogine too! And Seroquel but I 'forget' to take them. Oops 
@JSTJODIE Can I use #semtex while i'm on anti-depressants? (fluoxetine) xxx

Losing it. Could not remember the word power strip. Wonder which drug is doing this memory lapse thing. My guess the Cymbalta. #helps
@poobou thought I replied. Had horrible issues on it. Cried & slept for the whole month I was on it. Cymbalta worked better for me.
I think this Cymbalta is kicking in, I feeell..... Um..
@Lac20131993 they think that the tubing has disconnected from the pump and is leaking baclofen. They need to put it back together ASAP
@SeekingAlpha how do you think the $3 billion or so in fines for Risperdal and hips (let alone Levaquin, mesh, etc) will affect stock prices
@kezzy1975 but didn't because apparently it interacts with Lamotrigine I'm on. Weird.
@Mlp_Timelord *offers a lozenge*

I would need to triple my dosage of Vyvanse to get through the 52 pages of history I have left to study
Just timed a Cymbalta commercial. 50 of the 70 seconds was side effects and warnings. So, how bad is your arthritis??
You know you're going to have a bad day when you start off having run out of coffee and Prozac!
I wish I could be tired. Shouldn't have taken the vyvanse. Now I'm never sleeping.
I'm about to pop some Vyvanse, 'cause ya girl Meg Meezy is #TeamNoSleep
L'laila tov. By the way, I'm going into baclofen-pump surgery in Mid July (#Wewillseewhocares.).

@skernandez you take vyvanse? I was on that stuff for like 5 years. 70mg. but a few months ago I switched to adderall 30mg
Do not ever get on Cymbalta. Getting off of it is HELL!
@TheBravoBlonde UH....Batshit crazy..comes to mind for some reason...Someone cut-off the writers supply of Prozac? ....
I usually hate texting with a passion but when I'm on that good vyvanse and Special K it ain't no stopin me #Ayoungniggakeepinthestreesclean
oh yeah tip don't even begin to let negligence put you into a week without benzos + effexor because wowee I was crying for help to myself
Everyone's always upset in my house. Damn, take a prozac
@CNN lol "Losing a cymbal is no reason to reach for Cymbalta."
@citizenhorse Yeah K. Prozac probably isn't doing anything for his quality of life either feeling mopey all the time :-( Good luck!
My dog's on Prozac “@ananavarro: Dog's barking like crazy. Just heard another passenger offer her a valium. Yes, it's Miami.”
@1jaclynwatson Sounds better than a TCP lozenge! How can I have a sore throat when it's hot outside! Grrrrrr
This years finals brought to you by Vyvanse.
Thank God it is finally get cooler in London. I have been melting all day! I wonder if my medication reduces my tolerance to heat? #Seroquel
Can yu sell Paxil on the streets lol
@TyleerCombs it is vyvanse. And since you're being a little shit, you're getting a sack tap tomorrow in first hour
I'm surprisingly perky to say I'm three days off my prozac.
@FrancisWalter I hope that works. I found out Fosamax didn't help me on a DEXA scan, so was switched to Prolia injection twice a year.
They gave me an anti-depressant called Effexor XR. And from the sound of that name, I'm pretty sure it's made out of robots.
It is time for a Prozac
"No, I'm a positive person! You're like Santa Claus… on Prozac… at Disneyland… getting laid!"
@tessharding88 @TylerMF_Harding @raymtodd yeah...try 5 hours a day! It's terrible! But I have an abundance of vyvanse #theonlybreakfastineed
My mom called to tell me that my Prozac is here and that she also got me a bag of Starbursts.. is that supposed to balance it out? Lol.
No #Vyvanse = eat everything in sight.
Can I get a side of Prozac?
I couldn't remember if I took a vyvanse or not early so I took another one &now I'm spazzing out... bc obviously I took one already #adhd
@johncheese I hated effexor. It makes you hungry, dizzy, and lethargic. That culminated in a large weight gain for me.
@Seanras that looks more like Prozac worked
@ChangeMyTampon @PBandJenelley_1 @InfanousJames1 I thought she only took melatonin ti help her sleep. Seroquel is for bipolar not imsomnia

Things to do w/$150 instead of seeing Paxil Rose: Give it directly to @tommy_stinson. 37 pairs of socks at @brooklynbowl. Origami cicadas.
@DomLovesRaisa oh dear ..I mean depression sucks but C'mon are you that bad? Cymbalta can help.
I think the fact that I am again functioning at normal levels on 5-6 hours of sleep means that Effexor is finally out of my system. Yay?
@I_Have_Crohns Zyprexa, Risperdal, Seroquel, Lithium, Epival, and Trileptal all made an appearance with the antidepressants...

How on earth have I sunburnt a lozenge shape on to my thigh? Not allowed out in the summer. Now that's three seasons I'm excluded from.
It feels like my brain is melting. 360mg of vyvanse in 24 hours... not smart danielle. not smart.

I feel like all moms have to take vyvanse. There's no way I could clean a house, do laundry, dishes, and cook everyday without it
@MSdomin8 @AnonyRRMS tysabri has worked well for many. Hopefully it is the right fit & the option that works for you.
It's sad the only way I can get things done is if I take a vyvanse
@DanieLouize hi on channel 4 they're taking a little about victoza isn't that what you're using.?
Drug companies claiming word limits on articles prevent full study results being published, more like victoza causes pancreatitis
this programme is annoying me now, they just weren't prescribing the Victoza properly
@C4Dispatches Eeeeek. Just chucked my Victoza in the bin. I will take my chances with the diabetes #diabetes
@unguidedmissile I probably hv to stay on Humira until September, 6 months will b up then. Seeing doc 19th, will ask what he thinks.
Need more vyvanse for next week. Who can hook it up
Cymbalta where r u?
@LornaSmith_ yes I am lozenge
Only problem is I'm hungry. Seroquel nation hunger :(
Working out on vyvanse is so much better than without #crackedout
“@KyleThompson168: Working out on vyvanse is so much better than without #crackedout” I know how you feel brotha
@HeatherM211 @DavidJuurlink yup. Tho wonder if this is increased risk w/ dabigatran vs loss of protection from Coumadin.
Popular antidepressants Zoloft, Prozac and Paxil can lower libido and prevent orgasms
vyvanse makes me think too much 
I judge the time in the evenings by "can i get away with taking a seroquel to knock myself out yet or is it too early"
@jen_hintz i've been on cymbalta the longest out of any fibro med. so far no reaction. others were horrible.
@kas0x hahahahaa picture iwasui handing out condoms thinking its some kind of lozenge
Unfollowers hurt, Cymbalta can help

@almostwell yeh same bk felt like sumo wrestler on it all time :( think its f****ed me 4life :( ironic as Humira is used to treat artheritis

Vyvanse really is a life saver right now #nannyprobs

@MagnoliaPearl Missing a day of meds is never fun. I get migraines if I don't get my Effexor. Do you just get super tired?
Vyvanse is the only thing getting me thru this summer class. Reading full books in a day #thankgod #sofocused #sorelaxed

@catiemonster @mrsjesscharlton Oh, I'll never feel satisfied (remembers to take Cymbalta). But I take your point.

@Tuxedobird @gutgremlins On Humira about 8 yrs. Started every other week then weekly 2 yrs ago. Hate giving myself shots, But seems to work
@AuntFlo_28 often enough, that's for sure. It got better over time, though. But then it got weird again when I started Humira.

Damn seroquel kick in already. Daddy wants to go to dystopian dream land
@LooneyDem Yes, it is so frustrating. I'm already on the highest dose of Effexor and taking a relatively low dose of Lamictal.
Really could use a vyvanse right about now. Fuck summer classes
Sore throat? Drop of lemon or peppermint in a teaspoon of honey in place of a throat lozenge.
I don't know whether my Vyvanse caused my caffeine addiction or caffeine caused my Vyvanse addiction.
@DrKrys_2015 levofloxacin or avelox but I'm trying to wait
Vyvanse and cocaine are both schedule II drugs, coincidence? I think not.
@MelissaDee_ I do 2 per week - method and enbrel and its nothing.

Thank god my steady stream of vyvanse is wearing off, i can sleep now.
@martin_eve enbrel & mtx. Prob need to inc mtx but fighting s/x
@mathsie I'd probably need something a lot stronger if I weren't on duloxetine.
@thatkatiegirl @meghugs This is why I'm glad I got switched to Vyvanse. They hardly ever run out of it.
@_chanabeth_ @laceyKayBee I didn't stay long. And I took a vyvanse so I can't go back to sleep. Lol
Headache definitely not as bad today and the cymbalta needs some timing adjustments.
@EmmalineTrail @DanielaRowen A lot of crap sleeping pills & Seroquel. But that does sound like heaven....
@renegade_snare @IBDTweet I feel your pain :( just got 1st #fistula URGH ! Humira worked for me for just 3months then got painful reactions
@brain_opera I had to taper myself down. I think the Seroquel gave me lasting sleep paralysis. I've had it ever since.
@TheBloggess your lucky! I have to do infusions of remicade for my RA. I would happily do humera or enbrel if it didnt make me stop breathin
Actually, probably everything on our PBS is a synthetic drug. Shit you should see my medicine cabinet! Get that Seroquel in ya!
1 power point, 2 short stories, half of a small book, and an epic poem = #longnight and #vyvanse
@HurtBlogger good luck! Have you tried it before? Does it work 4 u? I just had 2nd dose of Humira, and hurting so bad I can't stand it :-(
Thank God for Zyprexa.
@mahaffey72 Orencia is brand new for me! I've been on Enbrel, Humira, Remicade, Cimzia, Humira again, and Actemra! Yeesh! Hope it works 4 u!
Glad that's over. Now if I can just get more vyvanse, I'll be goodz

@sibbywibbs I'm on fluoxetine; seems to do the trick for me. My wife used citalopram for her anxiety attacks.
@danecub I should really take a lozenge before these things.
My creativity was blocked by Lithium and Prozac and Wellbutrin and Paxil and Zoloft and Effexor and Lexapro and Cymbalta and Abilify-
@MesserFan I am refusing to take anymore of the Fluoxetine. I don't believe that it is helping me at all.
